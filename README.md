# Scrapping-Rotten-Tomatoes
Rotten Tomatoes is one of the world's most trusted recommendation resources for quality entertainment. As the leading online aggregator of movie and TV show reviews from critics, they provide fans with a comprehensive guide to what's Fresh – and what's Rotten – in theaters and at home. I have scrapped Rotten tomatoes websites using Web Scrapping technique and found out some most related information from it.
